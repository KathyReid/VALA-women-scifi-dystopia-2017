## Opening gambit

Good evening everyone. Most people would run screaming at the thought of spending an evening listening to a self-confessed nerd talk about science fiction, so thank you again for coming tonight.

### Imagine a dystopia

Everyone, I'd like you to imagine, in your mind's eye, a dystopia.

It may be one where the rights of women are curtailed. The natural environment may be devastated. A totalitarian government may keep tabs on its citizens through mass surveillance. An artificially intelligent army may be hell-bent on subjugating humans so they can dominate the planet.

Some of you may have imagined the misogynist theocracy of Gilead - from Margaret Atwood's Handmaid's Tale. The emacerated nuclear wastelands of literally hundreds of novels of atomic mishaps - manmade and accidental. Isobel Carmody's Obernewtyn series, On the Beach by Nevil Shute - and countless others. The Orwellian nightmare of Big Brother in 1984. Skynet of Terminator fame.

BUT HOW MANY OF YOU IMAGINED SCENES CLOSER TO HOME?

Did you visualise Trump's America - where the reproductive rights of women are increasingly scrutinised and legislated? Perhaps you dreamed of the radioactive wasteland surrounding Chernobyl, and the strontium-90 found in the bones of those who inhabit it. The desolation of Fukinowa, and the irradiated sealife washing up on its shores.

Perhaps you imagined governments that use facial recognition not just to track crime, but for political purposes. Wide scale data matching between Centrelink and the Australian Tax Office - used *not* for proactive purposes of identifying and protecting the vulnerable but as a pejorative measure against those who are largely reliant on social welfare - especially women.

Social networks - in effect walled gardens - that only allow you to see the "news" they want you to read - in other words, what their advertisers are paying for you to see. Using data about you to influence what you buy, what you wear - indeed, who you are.

Advances in artificial intelligence, machine learning and natural language processing continues apace, with scant little rigourous thinking around issues of machine ethics, and how we should explore this new frontier safely. Robots - electronic reflections of ourselves - have the power to reflect the very worst of humanity.

DYSTOPIA IS MUCH NEARER THAN WE OFTEN IMAGINE

### Framework of this talk



This evening's talk will weave a narrative, exploring different

If we think for a moment about what dystopia is




### Science fiction becoming science fact

Over the years, technologies and events that were once the sole dominion of science fiction have evolved into science fact. Real time communications, machines capable of storing and interpreting gargantuan amounts of big data




Themes of dystopia


Mass surveillance

Censorship


## Idolatry and celebrity

William Gibson's Idoru

An artificial intelligence , who changes her demeanour and appearance based on the preferences and desires of her audience.

There are parallels here with idolatry of celebrities such as Kim Kardassian

## Conclusion

In conclusion, librarians - as keepers of the truth, custodians of artefacts that belie and document our history - sit at the vanguard against dystopia.

You buffer the digitally disadvantaged from an era where access to services, to information and to resources is brokered entirely online -requiring new literacies to navigate.

In the words of perhaps the most famous science fiction princess of all time

Save us, Obi-wan kenobi, you're our only hope.
