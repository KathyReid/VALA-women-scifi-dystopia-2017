# Women, dystopia, science fiction and you

## Opening gambit

Good evening everyone. Most people would run screaming at the thought of spending an evening listening to a self-confessed nerd talk about science fiction, so thank you again for coming tonight.

### Imagine a dystopia

Everyone, I'd like you to imagine, in your mind's eye, a _dystopia_.

It may be one where the rights of women are curtailed. The natural environment may be devastated. A totalitarian government may keep tabs on its citizens through mass surveillance. It may be one where certain cohorts of the population are discriminated against based on certain characteristics. It may be one where an artificially intelligent army may be hell-bent on subjugating humans so they can dominate the planet.

Some of you may have imagined the misogynist theocracy of Gilead - from Margaret ATWOOD's 'Handmaid's Tale'. The emacerated nuclear wastelands of literally hundreds of novels of atomic mishaps - manmade and accidental. Isobel CARMODY's 'Obernewtyn' series, 'On the Beach' by Nevil SHUTE - and countless others. The ORWELLian nightmares of Big Brother in 1984, and the porcine supremacy of Animal Farm. Skynet of Terminator fame. HG WELLS' 'War of the Worlds' with its brutal, conquering Martians disrupting the peace of the English countryside.

BUT HOW MANY OF YOU IMAGINED SCENES CLOSER TO HOME?

Did you perhaps visualise Trump's America - where the reproductive rights of women are increasingly scrutinised and legislated? Perhaps you dreamed of the radioactive wasteland surrounding Chernobyl, and the strontium-90 found in the bones of those who inhabit it. The desolation of Fukinowa, and the irradiated sealife washing up on its shores.

Perhaps you imagined governments that use facial recognition not just to track crime, but for political purposes. Wide scale data matching between Centrelink and the Australian Tax Office - used *not* for proactive purposes of identifying and protecting the vulnerable but as a pejorative measure against those who are largely reliant on social welfare - especially women.

You might have imagined social networks - in effect walled gardens - that only allow you to see the "news" they want you to read - in other words, what their advertisers are paying for you to see. Using data about you to influence what you buy, what you wear - indeed, who you are.

You might have imagined a society where systemic barriers prevent significant cohorts of the population from participating equitably and equally in all aspects of life. Where some people can't marry those they love. Where half the population is paid on average 15.3% less than the other half for the same work.

You might have imagined a world where advances in artificial intelligence, machine learning and natural language processing continue apace, with scant little rigourous thinking around issues of machine ethics, and how society should explore this new frontier safely. Robots - electronic reflections of ourselves - have the power to reflect both the best - and the very worst of humanity.

DYSTOPIA IS MUCH NEARER THAN WE OFTEN IMAGINE

(Pause)

### Framework of this talk - dystopia are themes taken to the extreme

In all of these examples, a dystopia is created when one or more themes, policy decisions, social axes or technologies are taken to an unmoderated extreme, or combined in - sometimes frightening - ways.

This evening's talk will weave a narrative, exploring many of these technical and futuristic themes - big data, machine learning, artificial intelligence, ubiquitous computing - and how they're represented in science fiction, particularly through the roles portrayed by female characters.

As these technologies and themes increasingly evolve from science _fiction_ to science _fact_, I will also raise the question of what **your** role - your role as Librarians, archivists and technologists - will be  as we approach this 'Brave New World'. Just like Neo in the 'Matrix' - we have important choices before us. Will we take the _red pill_ or the _blue pill_? Are we even aware of what those choices **are**?

Down the rabbit hole we go ...

## THEME - Fertility

Fertility and reproduction are cornerstones of science fiction literature.

Alfonso Cuar√≥n's 2006 dystopian thriller 'Children of Men' takes this to several extremes - the human race's ability to reproduce has been severely inhibited by unknown factors, setting the scene for the desperate liberation of the first pregnant woman the world has seen in nearly two decades, against the backdrop of a refugee and immigration crisis. The irony of the world's only pregnant woman being of African descent is not accidental.

The spine-chilling series based on Margaret ATWOOD's 'Handmaid's Tale' via Hulu kicks the terror up a notch further, combining widespread infertility with the rise to power of theocratic, totalitarian right wing government with a penchant for oppressing women through not only violence, but the removal of their literacy.

SO WHAT DOES THIS ALL HAVE TO DO WITH WOMEN AND TECHNOLOGY?

In Australia, our national fertility rate is hovering about the 1.8 mark - that's 1.8 babies per woman. It's much less than the population replacement rate. There are many reasons for this - women are partnering later in life, necessitating the use of reproductive technology. The roles of women have changed over the decades - it's no longer a societal expectation that a woman's role is _just_ to raise a family.

Importantly though, economic factors are a consideration.

SLIDE: Gender pay gap

Women earn less. The current gender pay gap in Australia is a whopping 15.3% - as the August 2017 report from the Office of Workplace Gender Equality shows. There are many contributing factors to the gender pay gap.

* Discrimination and bias in hiring and pay decisions - men consistently negotiate and are offered higher salaries for similar roles.

* Women and men working in different industries - female dominated industries attract lower wages overall

* There is still a lack of workplace flexibility to accommodate caring and other responsibilities, especially in senior roles.

* And women's time out of the workforce for caring - raising families and/or providing care for the sick and elderly impacts career progression and opportunities.

* Women take a disproportionate share of unpaid caring and domestic work  - and this doesn't even take into account the _emotional labour_ that women attract in paid work. If someone is upset or clearly emotional in your workplace, is a woman or a man expected to care, and nurture that person?

Even in science fiction, women are often portrayed in the role of _carer_. Katniss Everdeen of the 'Hunger Games' cares not only for her sister and grief-stricken mother, but also for Peeta, nurturing him back to health. Even the fierce, brave, resilient and tough Ellen Ripley of 'Aliens' fame takes on a nurturing role, protecting the child survivor, Newt.

But what about women in scientific and technical roles? Surely the gender pay gaps are less in these areas?

It's even worse.

SLIDE: PERCENTAGE OF GRADUATES WITH INCOME OVER $104k BY DISCIPLINE

In this 2015 report by the Office of the Chief Scientist, the gender pay gap in STEM roles - science, technlogy, engineering and mathematics is even more marked in senior roles - this graph shows disparity across all disciplines. Interestingly though, information technology has one of the higher gender pay gaps at senior levels.

So of course all of this contributes to the theme of fertility, and goes some way to explain why women are having fewer children, or not bearing children at all.

### Fertility - what can we do about it?

So what choices do we have here?

* If women choose to have children - and we need to respect that choice - we need to better understand the flexibility that will assist in in balancing both work and caring commitments. There's no reason in this day and age of work anywhere - perhaps we should call that work everywhere - that job duties can't be made more flexible. And that flexibility should only become easier over time as technologies like videoconferencing, instant messaging, web conferencing and so on become more mature.

SLIDE: Move away from working at home at big technology companies

However, it's quite disheartening to see a shift in information technology away from the ability to work from home. Companies like Yahoo, IBM and Hewlett Packard have made working from home more difficult in recent years - ostensibly under the guise of increased "collaboration" and "engagement".

But at what cost?

SLIDE: Skills shortages

At the same time, the IT industry faces difficulty in recruiting for certain roles - often niche roles that require significant specialist knowledge like data science, artificial intelligence, user experience. It's absurd that the industry makes it harder, not easier to attract more women - why on earth would you want to reduce the candidate pool you're recruiting from by half?

So, creating flexible workplaces - allowing women to balance competing demands of child-raising, care and employment - something Libraries have traditionally done well -  is one step away from dystopia.

## THEME - Literacy as a tool of oppression or empowerment

There's another - very confronting dystopian theme in Margaret ATWOOD's 'Handmaid's Tale' that I'd also like to unpack a little bit.

In the world of the Republic of Gilead, women are forbidden from reading. Literacy is used as a tool of oppression. We've seen parallels of this throughout history - reading and writing were originally a skill of only priests and upper-class people. If a culture didn't have written traditions - like many Australian Indigenous cultures - it was considered inferior.

Thankfully today Australia's literacy rate is reasonably healthy - although we do have some challenges with adult literacy in certain cohorts, such as those for whom English is a second language, and those who left school before Year 12.

So again, what does this have to do with Women in IT?

Written and numerical literacy is only one element of literacy. As computing, and digital transformation affects every element of our society, **digital literacy** is becoming more and more important. Digital literacy is a broad swathe of capabilities that essentially connote the ability to use digital technology effectively.

In 2017, Telstra, in partnership with RMIT and Swinburne, released the 2017 edition of the Australian Digital Inclusion Index. The Index rates the different states on their digital inclusivity along the axes of

* access - whether internet access is available
* affordability - what the price point of internet access is, relative to household income
* digital ability - and the capabilities of people once they have internet access

The report, unsurprisingly, pulled no punches. It showed that overal, Australia's digital inclusion is growing. But the gap between the digital capable and those less capable - the **digital divide** - is also growing.

And that's worrying for a number of reasons. Firstly, access to many government services is now digitally based, and more and more services are going online over time. If you don't have strong digital ability, it's more difficult to access the services, that paradoxically, you're more in need of. How many of you in public libraries are now spending a lot of time with people who need help navigating the online web portals of government services? How well are those services designed? A cynic might say that they've deliberately been designed that way to provide a barrier to entry. _Remember, dystopia is always closer than we imagine it to be_.

Secondly, the **digital divide** is worrying because those people who don't have digital skills are going to find it harder and harder to seek and retain employment in the digital age. And remember those slides about the 15.3% gender pay gap, and the even bigger pay gap between males and females in STEM as you get to more senior roles? Yes, there's a digital divide along gender lines as well.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, librarians - as keepers of the truth, custodians of artefacts that belie and document our history - sit at the vanguard against dystopia.

You buffer the digitally disadvantaged from an era where access to services, to information and to resources is brokered entirely online -requiring new literacies to navigate.
