# Women, dystopia, science fiction and you

## Opening gambit

Good evening everyone. Most people would run screaming at the thought of spending an evening listening to a self-confessed nerd talk about science fiction, so thank you again for coming tonight.

### Imagine a dystopia

Everyone, I'd like you to imagine, in your mind's eye, a _dystopia_.

It may be one where the rights of women are curtailed. The natural environment may be devastated. A totalitarian government may keep tabs on its citizens through mass surveillance. It may be one where certain cohorts of the population are discriminated against based on certain characteristics. It may be one where an artificially intelligent army may be hell-bent on subjugating humans so they can dominate the planet.

Some of you may have imagined the misogynist theocracy of Gilead - from Margaret ATWOOD's 'Handmaid's Tale'. The emacerated nuclear wastelands of literally hundreds of novels of atomic mishaps - manmade and accidental. Isobel CARMODY's 'Obernewtyn' series, 'On the Beach' by Nevil SHUTE - and countless others. The ORWELLian nightmares of Big Brother in 1984, and the porcine supremacy of Animal Farm. Skynet of Terminator fame. HG WELLS' 'War of the Worlds' with its brutal, conquering Martians disrupting the peace of the English countryside.

BUT HOW MANY OF YOU IMAGINED SCENES CLOSER TO HOME?

Did you perhaps visualise Trump's America - where the reproductive rights of women are increasingly scrutinised and legislated? Perhaps you dreamed of the radioactive wasteland surrounding Chernobyl, and the strontium-90 found in the bones of those who inhabit it. The desolation of Fukinowa, and the irradiated sealife washing up on its shores.

Perhaps you imagined governments that use facial recognition not just to track crime, but for political purposes. Wide scale data matching between Centrelink and the Australian Tax Office - used *not* for proactive purposes of identifying and protecting the vulnerable but as a pejorative measure against those who are largely reliant on social welfare - especially women.

You might have imagined social networks - in effect walled gardens - that only allow you to see the "news" they want you to read - in other words, what their advertisers are paying for you to see. Using data about you to influence what you buy, what you wear - indeed, who you are.

You might have imagined a society where systemic barriers prevent significant cohorts of the population from participating equitably and equally in all aspects of life. Where some people can't marry those they love. Where half the population is paid on average 15.3% less than the other half for the same work.

You might have imagined a world where advances in artificial intelligence, machine learning and natural language processing continue apace, with scant little rigourous thinking around issues of machine ethics, and how society should explore this new frontier safely. Robots - electronic reflections of ourselves - have the power to reflect both the best - and the very worst of humanity.

DYSTOPIA IS MUCH NEARER THAN WE OFTEN IMAGINE

### Framework of this talk - dystopia are themes taken to the extreme

In all of these examples, a dystopia is created when one or more themes, policy decisions, social axes or technologies are taken to an unmoderated extreme, or combined in - sometimes frightening - ways.

This evening's talk will weave a narrative, exploring many of these technical and futuristic themes - big data, machine learning, artificial intelligence, ubiquitous computing - and how they're represented in science fiction, particularly through the roles portrayed by female characters.

As these technologies and themes increasingly evolve from science _fiction_ to science _fact_, I will also raise the question of what **your** role - your role as Librarians, archivists and technologists - will be  as we approach this 'Brave New World'. Just like Neo in the 'Matrix' - we have important choices before us. Will we take the _red pill_ or the _blue pill_? Are we even aware of what those choices **are**?

Down the rabbit hole we go ...

## THEME - Fertility

Fertility and reproduction are cornerstones of science fiction literature.

Alfonso Cuarón's 2006 dystopian thriller 'Children of Men' takes this to several extremes - the human race's ability to reproduce has been severely inhibited by unknown factors, setting the scene for the desperate liberation of the first pregnant woman the world has seen in nearly two decades, against the backdrop of a refugee and immigration crisis. The irony of the world's only pregnant woman being of African descent is not accidental.

The spine-chilling series based on Margaret ATWOOD's 'Handmaid's Tale' via Hulu kicks the terror up a notch further, combining widespread infertility with the rise to power of theocratic, totalitarian right wing government with a penchant for oppressing women through not only violence, but the removal of their literacy.

So what does this all have to do with women and women in technology?

In Australia, our national fertility rate is hovering about the 1.8 mark - that's 1.8 babies per woman. It's much less than the population replacement rate. There are many reasons for this - women are partnering later in life, necessitating the use of reproductive technology.

Importantly though, economic factors are a consideration. Women earn less. The current gender pay gap in Australia is a whopping 15.3%

## Idolatry and celebrity

There are parallels here with idolatry of celebrities such as Kim Kardassian

## Conclusion

In conclusion, librarians - as keepers of the truth, custodians of artefacts that belie and document our history - sit at the vanguard against dystopia.

You buffer the digitally disadvantaged from an era where access to services, to information and to resources is brokered entirely online -requiring new literacies to navigate.

In the words of perhaps the most famous science fiction princess of all time
